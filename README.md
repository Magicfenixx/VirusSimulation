# VirusSimulation

Objective:
The aim of this project is to simulate the spread of a virus in a population using the NetLogo modeling environment, and then analyze and visualize the results within MATLAB. This integration leverages the .nlogo file format to simulate complex agent-based models and provides a powerful analytical framework through MATLAB.

Description:

NetLogo Simulation:

A NetLogo model (Virus.nlogo) is utilized, which simulates the spread of a virus within a population. This model uses an agent-based approach to simulate how a virus transmits between individuals, how the infection progresses, and how it eventually leads to recovery or further spread within the population.
The .nlogo file contains the entire setup of the simulation, including the initial conditions, parameters (like infection rate, recovery rate, etc.), and the agents' behavior in response to the virus.
